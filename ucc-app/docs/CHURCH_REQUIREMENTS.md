## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Online Giving (Givelify)

**Priority:** 🔴 High – This directly enables the church to receive donations online

**What I Need:**

- [ ] The Givelify giving page link (URL) for Unity Community Church

**How to Get It:**

1. Log into [analytics.givelify.com](https://analytics.givelify.com) with the church's Givelify account
2. Go to **Giving Tools** → **Online Giving**
3. Copy the "Online Giving Link" and send it to me

**How It Will Be Used:**
When visitors click "Give with Givelify" on the website, they will be taken directly to this secure page to complete their donation. All donation processing, receipts, and tax records are handled by Givelify—the website simply provides a convenient link.

---

### 2. Online Giving (Cash App)

**Priority:** 🔴 High – Alternative giving option for members who prefer Cash App

**What I Need:**

- [ ] The church's Cash App $Cashtag (e.g., `$UnityChurch`)

**How It Will Be Used:**
When visitors click "Give with Cash App" on the website, they will be directed to send money to this $Cashtag. This is a simple, one-click experience for donors.

---

### 3. Facebook Live Stream Automation

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium – Saves weekly manual work and keeps the website current

**What I Need:**

- [ ] Admin access to the Unity Community Church Facebook Page
- [ ] Or: The church's Facebook Page ID

**What This Enables:**
Currently, someone must manually update the website every Sunday with the new live stream video. With access to the Facebook page, I can set up automation that:

- Automatically shows the latest Sunday service video
- Displays a "We're Live!" banner when a service is streaming
- Never requires manual updates again

**Security Note:**
I would create a dedicated "App" through Facebook's developer tools that only has permission to _read_ videos—it cannot post, delete, or modify anything on the page.

**Alternative Option:**
If you prefer not to grant access, the website can continue with the current manual process where someone copies the video code each week.

---

### 4. YouTube Media Archive

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium – Allows automatic sermon archive updates

**What I Need:**

- [ ] Link to the church's YouTube channel
- [ ] Confirmation of which playlist(s) contain sermon recordings

**How It Will Be Used:**
The website will automatically display the latest sermons from YouTube. When a new video is uploaded to the church's channel, it will appear on the website without any manual updates needed.

---

### 5. Contact Form Email

**Priority:** 🔴 High – Required for the contact page to work

**What I Need:**

- [ ] The email address where contact form submissions should be sent (e.g., `info@unitychurch.org`)

**How It Will Be Used:**
When visitors fill out the "Contact Us" form on the website, their message will be delivered to this email address. The church can respond directly from their normal email.
